Conundrum! We have a build project whereby some of the content, which includes anchors. And we're rendering the content, safely, in React.

But here's the cinch. The anchors aren't transformed into `<Link>`, which means clicking them reloads the entire app. ðŸ˜°

I've tried all manner of different techniques, but none have worked or been straight forward to implement. If you have an idea - [tweet me](https://twitter.com/mmjg2011) - I'd love to hear it!
