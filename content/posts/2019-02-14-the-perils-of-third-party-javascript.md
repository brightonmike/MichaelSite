title: The perils of third-party JavaScript

I work in a sector of the web industry where third-parties are particularly heavily relied on. They provide all sorts of functionality - marketing, data analysis, ðŸ¤”tracking, social media and more. We should always try to understand the business decisions behind using third-party services. But equally, we should also consider their impact.

## Slower sites

The fact is that even adding one third-party feature, such as a live chat, can significantly affect the performance, functionality, stability and security of your website. For example, I was recently tasked with adding Zendesk live chat to a new client build.

Unfortunately, this means loading over 800kb of extra resources including over 700kb of JavaScript. Yikes. Worse, this means that the browser struggles to handle just evaluating the JS. In a performance audit in dev tools, the browser raises several red flags. It's worth noting, this is on a 2-year old Macbook Pro, and I'm not throttling the CPU. It's scary to think how poor the performance will be on a mid-range Smartphone.

It's even scarier to think this is just one third-party script. You can imagine how bad things quickly get when we're pulling in several others. All these scripts, network requests and files considerably slow websites down and create a poorer user experience.

## Solutions?

There are some things we can do to try to mitigate the impact. We can add the \`defer\` attribute to JavaScript files so they don't block page rendering. We can also feedback, often via Github, to the authors of the third-party extensions and help them to improve performance.

But sometimes we'll need a technical solution.
