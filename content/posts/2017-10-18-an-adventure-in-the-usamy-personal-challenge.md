Just over three weeks ago, I returned from 18 days exploring the west side of the USA. Starting in LA, I spent three days exploring this sprawling metropolis. I then spent seven days on a group road trip through California, Arizona and Nevada, checking out Joshua Tree National Park, Grand Canyon, Vegas and Yosemite along the way. I ended up in San Francisco, which I explored for three days before a mini road trip back down to LA by way of Monterey and San Luis Obispo.

This year was a big change for me, as I was put on Xarelto/Rivaroxaban,  a blood thinner, for the rest of my life. This would reduce my chances of getting blood clots, as I have both Protein C and Protein S deficiencies, which make me particularly at risk. I was told that taking the medication would allow me to live a life of normal length, whereas if I did not, I would likely die much younger.

That in itself has been a hard thing to cope with personally. When I booked my trip, I saw it as an opportunity and deal with this big change in my life. Xarelto is a risky medication to take, if you cut yourself or injure yourself, you will bleed for much longer than normal.

After my first three days in LA, I met up with a group of fellow travellers for an organised road trip. At first, I didn’t tell anyone, but I confided in my room mate. At first he was quite worried, but after we chatted about it, he seemed reassured that I would be fine for the trip. Later on in the trip, I told various people about it when it came up naturally in the conversation.

A moment I kept private until later on the trip, which scared me a bit, was grazing my knee in Joshua Tree National Park. We were hours from anywhere, and go knows how far from a hospital, so pretty much the worst place to have an injury whilst on a blood thinner. Luckily my knee didn’t bleed that much, and it seemed pretty normal, but it was still a pretty nervy moment. I didn’t want to cause alarm though so I kept my concern to myself.

Throughout the whole trip, taking my medication was tricky at times and it was difficult to ensure I always took it at the same time. But I managed it pretty well in the end and never missed a pill. Eventually on the third to last day of the trip, I confided in my tour leader and chatted to him about it. He was extremely supportive and told me a story about a relative that was similar, and that just made me feel so much better about it. 

I’d hate to turn a molehill into a mountain as I know that when it comes to adversity, there are bigger challenges than going on a trip whilst taking Xarelto. But for me, it was a huge thing to overcome and a personal challenge. I’m extremely glad I did it though. I proved to myself that taking the medication, and discovering the conditions that I had, needn’t stop me enjoying my life and doing the things I want to do. After the trip I felt empowered, and mentally, it’s made me cope with the changes this year much better. I’d like to say as well how understanding and kind those I talked to about it were. Everyones support has been amazing.
