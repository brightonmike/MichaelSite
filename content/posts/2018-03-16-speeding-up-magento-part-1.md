Somehow…I have found myself working as a front-end developer at a Magento agency. After years of working with WordPress, my interest in creating brochure CMS sites had waned. I’ll always love it, and love working with it, but the challenge aspect had gone from my role. It had kinda become a bit too routine.

I’d not heard brilliant things about Magento, including the new Magento 2, before I started in my new role, but  throwing myself into a deep pit of “wtf” kinda sounds like fun even if I know it’s going to be stressful at times too.

One of the biggest criticisms of Magento 2, and the platform in general, is how slow it is. By default, Magento 2 dishes up dozens of CSS and JS files as well as a complex mark-up structure that can be difficult to extend without increasing the level of complexity exponentially. You can quickly lose control, and at the agency I’m at, use of Bluefoot CMS adds more layers of complexity to the front-end.
